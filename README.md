An Overview of Prosper
Prosper was founded in 2005 as the first peer-to-peer lending marketplace in the United States. Since then, Prosper has facilitated more than $23 billion in loans to more than 1,370,000 people.

Through Prosper, people can invest in each other in a way that is financially and socially rewarding. Borrowers apply online for a fixed-rate, fixed-term loan between 2000 and 40000 

Individuals and institutions can invest in the loans and earn attractive returns. Prosper handles all loan servicing on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors.

At the end of this project we expect to understand the motivation towards loan acquisitions and what factors contribute to loan favorability and how they affect each other

The Dataset
The original data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.
